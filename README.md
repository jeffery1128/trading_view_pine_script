# trading_view_pine_script

Pine script is a programming language created by TradingView to backtest trading strategies and create custom indicators.

In this project, I have used DMI, MACD, SAR and KDJ as an indicators to backtest the win rate of this combination.When these indicators have a bullish signal within 5 days. The backtest system will mark a virtual trading record.
